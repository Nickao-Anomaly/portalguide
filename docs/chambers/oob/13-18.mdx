# Out of Bounds 13-18
These chambers have been combined due to similarity.

## Beginner

### Under Elevator 1
Easiest under elevator route that allows you to do chambers 13 to 18 very similarly.

## Advanced

### Under Elevator 2
:::caution Not recommended
Much harder variation of Under Elevator where you have to do all chambers under time pressure to save a minimum amount of time each.

There is currently no tutorial for the Under Elevator 3 route, but it is recommended that you watch the current world record and try to
learn it by watching rather than learning UE2.
