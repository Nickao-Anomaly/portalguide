# Out of Bounds 00/01

## Beginner

### Legacy
The easiest route beginners can start with, loses a bunch of time over vault skip, but can be used in case you're not comfortable with saveloading 
yet.

## Intermediate

### Vault skip
Chamber 00 strategy that uses the radio to get out of the vault well before the portal opens. This can be paired with chamber 01 strats 
such as BSG or Omelette skip.

### Button Save Glitch (BSG)
Chamber 01 strategy that uses the radio to activate the button faster and skips waiting for the cube. This cannot be used in 3420 due to
absence of the 01 radio.

## Advanced

### Omelette skip
:::caution Build 3420 Exclusive
Currently the fastest 00/01 strategy when paired with Vault Skip. Uses the cube on Chamber 01 to get on top of the elevator and skip the 
02 dialogue. (Loses a few seconds in 00/01 compared to Vault skip + BSG, but saves a ton of time in 02/03). Use [this video](https://youtu.be/q6D-HgOO4Zc?t=175)
in order to learn the 02 "gap jump".

## Outdated
Strats and routes on this section are not recommended because of being either harder AND slower than strats above or just not used anymore 
because of better alternatives.

### Rubby Saveglitch
Different Chamber 00 strat that uses the radio to to lose collision after the first portal opens, letting you fly right to the elevator 
at the end.
