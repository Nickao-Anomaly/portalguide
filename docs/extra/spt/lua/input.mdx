# Input

The input library provides the ability to simulate inputs. This is useful for systems like TAS, or just using a script
to execute a sequence of inputs, perfectly timed.

## Example
###### Note: This example is wrapped in `game.async` so we can use `wait` to wait for an event, like the player teleporting.
```lua title="portal/lua/scripts/input_example.lua"
game.async(function()
    input.forward:hold()

    -- Wait for the player to go through a portal
    events.player_teleport:wait()

    -- release forward, hold left, and tap jump (meaning press for 1 tick, then release)
    input.forward:release()
    input.left:hold()
    input.jump:tap()
end)
```
