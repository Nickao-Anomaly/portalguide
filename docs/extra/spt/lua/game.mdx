# Game

The game library provides useful functions for interacting with the game. This includes saving and loading, starting/stopping
demo recording, getting the game directory, pausing, and launching "async" tasks.

## Example

```lua title="portal/lua/scripts/game_example.lua"
game.save("test-save")

game.load("test-save")

console.msg("Game Directory: %s", game.get_directory())
```
