# Entity

The entity library allows you to interface with entities in the game. This includes the player, cameras, triggers, orbs,
turrets, and more. You can use this library to get information about entities, like their position, or to modify them,
like changing their position.

## Example

```lua title="portal/lua/scripts/entity_example.lua"
local entity = entity.from_id(37)

console.msg("Entity 37 is at position %s\n", entity:get_pos())

entity:set_pos(vec3(0, 0, 0))

local closest = entity.closest("prop_energy_ball")

if closest ~= nil then
    console.msg("The closest energy ball to the player is at position %s\n", closest:get_pos())
end
```
