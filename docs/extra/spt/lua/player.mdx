# Player

The player library extends a lot of the same functionality from the entity library, but is specific to the player.
There are some player specific functions, like `get_local_ang` and `get_local_pos` that are not available on all
entities.

## Example

```lua title="portal/lua/scripts/player_example.lua"
console.msg("Player is at position %s\n", player.get_pos())

player.set_pos(vec3(0, 0, 0))

local local_angles = player.get_local_ang()
console.msg("Player local angles are %s\n", local_angles)
```
