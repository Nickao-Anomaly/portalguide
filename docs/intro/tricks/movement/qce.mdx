# QCE

QCE, or "quick crouch entry", is a technique that allows you to enter standing from a crouched position in around
three ticks. This is used often in conjunction with portals, but can also be used off edges. The primary benefit
of QCE is to prevent "falling" through a floor portal, and instead appearing on the other side standing very quickly.

## How to QCE

To QCE with portals, you first shoot one of your portals on a wall. Then, crouch, wait a moment, and uncrouch. While your
character is rising from the uncrouch, shoot the other portal on the floor. If done correctly, you will appear on the
other side of the portal nearly instantly, standing.
