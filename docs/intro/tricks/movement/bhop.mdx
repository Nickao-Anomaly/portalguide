# Bhop

Bhop, short for "bunny hopping", is a movement technique that allows you to move faster than normal by jumping and strafing.
It is a very important skill to learn in order to get faster times, and is used not only in almost every map, but also
in most Source Engine games as a whole. This skill is transferable to games like Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, and
many more.

## How To

The science behind bhopping is simple. When you jump, you gain a small amount of speed. When you strafe, you also gain
speed. When you jump and strafe at the same time, you gain even more speed. The goal of bhopping is to gain as much speed
as possible, and to keep that speed for as long as possible. This is done by jumping and strafing at the same time. To
maintain as much speed as possible, you also want to jump as soon as you hit the ground.

To make this easier, you can bind your jump key to your mouse wheel. This allows you input jump commands much faster than
you would be able to with a keyboard. To do this, open the console and type `bind mwheelup +jump` and `bind mwheeldown +jump`.


### No Strafe

The easiest way to bhop is to not strafe at all. This is often referred to as "w hopping". To do this, just walk forward,
jump, and jump again as soon as you hit the ground. This is the easiest way to bhop, but it is also the slowest. Furthermore,
it also puts you at a higher risk of accidentally ahopping, which would invalidate a glitchless run. The risk is that you
might accidentally turn your mouse too much before your next hop, causing you to ahop.

### Single Strafe

The next level of bhopping is to incorporate strafing, as was mentioned in the "How To" section. Single strafe bhopping
is when you strafe only in one direction between jumps. This is typically easier for most players, and it takes a considerable
amount of skill to actually gain and maintain speed from double strafing.

To single strafe, you want to jump, strafe in one direction, and jump again as soon as you hit the ground. If you intend
to go in a straight line, you will alternate your strafes between left and right. If you intend to continue turning in
one direction, you'll strafe in that direction again after you jump.

### Double Strafe
