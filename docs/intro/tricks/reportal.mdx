# Reportal

Reportal is a trick that allows you to gain more exit velocity when going through a portal. This is used in a few places
in the glitchless category, like chamber 14, high level chamber 15, and intermediate to high level chamber 18. It is also
used in other categories in a few places.

## How To
It is done by placing a portal on a surface, and then placing the other portal as well. Then, while travelling through
one of the portals, you shoot the portal you are entering away from you, and it lands very shortly after you enter the portal.
This transfer of portal placement causes the game to push you away from the center of the portal when it lands, giving you
more exit velocity.
