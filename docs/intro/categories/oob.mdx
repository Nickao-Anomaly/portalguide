# OOB

OOB, or "out of bounds", represents what most other games call "any%". The objective of this category is to beat the game
as fast as possible, using any means allowed within the global game speedrunning rules. This includes using glitches,
save load abuse, and other unintended mechanics.

## Objective

Beat the game by any means necessary, while following the global game rules.
