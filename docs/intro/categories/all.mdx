# All Categories

All categories have the same objective in mind; complete the game as fast as possible without breaking the rules of the
category, or any global rules. The main difference between categories is the rules that are set in place to make the
category unique. This page will go over the global rules that apply to all categories, while each sub page for each
category will go into the rule set that makes that category unique.

## Global Rules

### Version
You can use any version of the game.

### Assets
Modifying the games textures is allowed, however, wall and floor textures are blacklisted from change. This is to prohibit
the use of markers on walls/floors to help line up precise shots.

It is permissible to make cosmetic and size changes to fonts in "SourceScheme.res".

### Save/Load Abuse

If you are using an older version of LiveSplit and/or a demo parsing plugin, specifically before "0th tick" was timed
properly, you may be able to save and load your game repeatedly to get a faster time. **This is not allowed in any category.**
However, save/load abuse is still allowed for the purposes of performing tricks that require it, such as
[save glitch](/tricks/save-glitch) and [bsg](/tricks/bsg).

### Commands

All commands outside the [whitelist](/commands-options-binds#commands) are banned, unless explicitly allowed in a category's rules.

### Other


Copymap is banned.
