# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with speedrunning [Portal (2008)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)).

It will explain how to set up the game, the various versions of the game
that are commonly used in speedrunning, and various tools that are used to help speedrunners. It will also explain
the techniques used in Portal speedrunning, and how to perform them.

:::tip Play Portal casually first.
Before you start, you should have a basic understanding of how to play Portal. If you have never played Portal before,
you should play through the game casually before attempting to speedrun it. This isn't strictly required, but it is highly
recommended.

## Versions

First, you should be familiar with the various versions of Portal. Each version explained below has its own page with
more information, and its own reasons for being used. There are technically more versions of Portal, but these are the
most commonly used ones.

### [Source Unpack](https://wiki.sourceruns.org/wiki/Source_Unpack)

Source Unpack is an archive of the game's files at particular points
in time. It is used for speedrunning, because it allows you to use older versions of the game that have more glitches
and exploits. It also "unpacks" the games asset files for easy access, and includes a few other useful tools like
[SPT](https://github.com/YaLTeR/SourcePauseTool) and the [Speedrun Demo Record Plugin](https://github.com/RedHaze/speedrun-demo-record-unified).
Source Unpack is community driven, very reputable, and very safe. If you are concerned about it's safety, you can
technically use the Steam version of the game, but it is not recommended.

:::info Versions
<Tabs defaultValue="5135">
    <TabItem value="steampipe" label="Steampipe">
        This is the version of the game that comes with Steam. Typically, this version is not used for speedrunning. It
        is recommended that you use Source Unpack instead, because Steampipe patches out various glitches and exploits
        commonly used in speedruns.<br /><br />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="5135" label="5135">
        This is the most commonly used version of Source Unpack, which is based on the 5135 build of the game. It is
        recommended that you use this version for speedrunning, unless you are doing high level OOB or NoSLA runs. If you
        are just getting started, this is typically the way to go.<br /><br />

    <TabItem value="3420" label="3420">
        This is an older version of Source Unpack, which is based on the 3420 build of the game. It is recommended that
        you use this version for OOB and high level NoSLA runs. If you are just getting started, this is typically not
        necessary to use.<br /><br />

## Tools

### [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/downloads/)

LiveSplit is a popular timer used for speedrunning. It is highly customizable, and can be used for many different
games. It is recommended that you use LiveSplit for Portal speedruns, because it has a built-in plugin for recording
game time. This is important, because we don't time Portal runs by real time, we do it with engine ticks.

### [Speedrun Demo Record Plugin](https://github.com/RedHaze/speedrun-demo-record-unified)
:::note Likely Already Installed
If you installed a Source Unpack version of Portal, you do not need to install this plugin. It is already included.
:::

This is a plugin for Portal that automatically records demos when you start a run. It is highly recommended that you
use this plugin, because it makes recording runs much easier.

### Recording Software
It's also recommended that you use a recording software to record your runs. This is not required, but you'll find
yourself wanting to record your runs eventually. There are many different recording software, but the most popular
ones are [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and [Nvidia Shadowplay](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/shadowplay/).

### [UntitledParser](https://github.com/UncraftedName/UncraftedDemoParser)

UntitledParser is a demo parser for Source Engine games. This will be useful for calculating your run's time, however
it is not required. If you are using LiveSplit, it will give you the time automatically if you've configured it correctly.
