# Saves

## Vault Save <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/resourceasset/2e631"><button className="button button--primary">Download</button></a> {#vault_save}
Vault Save is a standard save used in Portal speedrunning that is used to skip the waiting in the Vault. In most categories,
you eventually learn how to skip the vault, so you don't use this, but for glitchless and legacy inbounds, this is very
helpful.

To use it, you need to put the `vault.sav` file in the `portal/SAVE` directory in your Portal installation directory.
Then, set the speedrun plugin to use it by typing `speedrun_save vault` in the console.

## Category Saves

These are some collections of saves that can be useful for practicing. They are organized by category, all following
a certain naming convention.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

        This is the most commonly used version of Source Unpack, which is based on the 5135 build of the game. It is
        recommended that you use this version for speedrunning, unless you are doing high level OOB or NoSLA runs. If you
        are just getting started, this is typically the way to go.<br /><br />

        you use this version for high level OOB and NoSLA runs. If you are just getting started, this is typically not

## Usage

Download the `zip` archive of saves that you want, and extract them to the `portal/SAVE` folder in your Portal
installation directory. Then, go in game, and type `load `, where you should be greeted with an autocomplete list of saves.

## Naming Convention

The saves are named in the following format:

`<category>-<map>[?il]-<description>`
- `category` is the shorthand of the category of the save, such as `gl` for glitchless or `inbob` for inbounds.
- `map` is the name of the chamber the save is for, such as `11` or `12`.
- `il` is an optional flag that indicates that the save is in the previous map, making it work with `speedrun_segment` and a valid IL save.
- `description` is a short description of the save, such as `spiderman` or `adam`.
