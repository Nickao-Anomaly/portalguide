# Saves

## Vault Save <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/resourceasset/2e631"><button className="button button--primary">Download</button></a> {#vault_save}
Vault Save is a standard save used in Portal speedrunning that is used to skip the waiting in the Vault. In most categories,
you eventually learn how to skip the vault, so you don't use this, but for glitchless and legacy inbounds, this is very
helpful.

To use it, you need to put the `vault.sav` file in the `portal/SAVE` directory in your Portal installation directory.
Then, set the speedrun plugin to use it by typing `speedrun_save vault` in the console.

## Wakeup Saves for 3420 <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/resourceasset/s5tev"><button className="button button--primary">Download</button></a> {#wakeup_saves}
Wakeup saves for 3420 differ from standard vault save. The usage is the same, except this resource includes two saves; one
for 75 FOV, and one for 90 FOV, because 3420 can't change the FOV through the console.

## Category Saves

These are some collections of saves that can be useful for practicing. They are organized by category, all following
a certain naming convention.

## Usage

Download the `zip` archive of saves that you want, and extract them to the `portal/SAVE` folder in your Portal
installation directory. Then, go in game, and type `load `, where you should be greeted with an autocomplete list of saves.

## Naming Convention

The saves are named in the following format:

`<category>-<map>[?il]-<description>`
- `category` is the shorthand of the category of the save, such as `gl` for glitchless or `inbob` for inbounds.
- `map` is the name of the chamber the save is for, such as `11` or `12`.
- `il` is an optional flag that indicates that the save is in the previous map, making it work with `speedrun_segment` and a valid IL save.
- `description` is a short description of the save, such as `spiderman` or `adam`.
