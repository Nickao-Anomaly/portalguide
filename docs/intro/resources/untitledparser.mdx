UntitledParser is a demo parser for Source Engine games. This will be useful for calculating your run's time, however
it is not required. If you are using LiveSplit, it will give you the time automatically if you've configured it correctly.

## Usage

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/UncraftedName/UncraftedDemoParser/releases).

Now you can drag a `.dem` file onto the executable. It will open a console window and write a bunch of demo information
into it.

Alternatively, you can also drag a directory of demos onto the executable. It will then properly time all of them. This
is useful for timing your run if you don't use LiveSplit and only record demos with the demo auto record plugin.
