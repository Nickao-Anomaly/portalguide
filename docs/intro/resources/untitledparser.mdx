# UntitledParser <a href="https://github.com/UncraftedName/UncraftedDemoParser/releases"><button className="button button--primary">Download</button></a>


UntitledParser is a demo parser for Source Engine games. This will be useful for calculating your run's time, though
it is not required. If you are using LiveSplit, it will give you the time automatically if you've configured it correctly.

## Usage

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/UncraftedName/UncraftedDemoParser/releases).

### Single Demo File
Now you can drag a `.dem` file onto the executable. It will open a console window and write a bunch of demo information
into it.

### Directory of Demo Files
Alternatively, you can also drag a directory of demos onto the executable. It will then properly time all of them. This
is useful for timing your run if you don't use LiveSplit and only record demos with the demo auto record plugin.

### How To Use As A Default
You can also set it up to be used whenever you open a demo by double clicking on it. Following the image below then selecting UntitledParser.exe.
Make sure that it is not in a location where you can accidentally delete it later on, like your downloads folder.
