# LiveSplit <a href="https://livesplit.org/downloads/"><button className="button button--primary">Download</button></a>

LiveSplit is a popular timer used for speedrunning. It is highly customizable, and can be used for many different
games. It is recommended that you use LiveSplit for Portal speedruns, because it has a built-in plugin for recording
game time. This is important, because we don't time Portal runs by real time, we do it with engine ticks.

## Setup

:::tip Skip Manual Setup
You don't need to manually create the splits file, there is a preset file at the bottom of this page.
:::

To get started with LiveSplit, you'll need to download it from the link above. Once you've downloaded it, open it up.
You'll be greeted with a small window with "0.00" on it.

Right Click, then go to "Edit Splits..." at the top. From there, configure "Game Name" to be "Portal", and
"Run Category" to be whichever category you'd like to run.
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "225px"}} src="/img/tools/livesplit/edit-splits.png"></img>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "225px"}} src="/img/tools/livesplit/game-and-cat.png"></img>
</div>
<br />

Finally, you need to add all the segments. To do this, name the first segment "00/01", then click "Insert Below". Add all
the segments up to e02.

The maps in order are: `00/01` `02/03` `04/05` `06/07` `08` `09` `10` `11/12` `13` `14` `15` `16` `17` `18` `19` `e00` `e01` `e02`

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "225px"}} src="/img/tools/livesplit/segments.png"></img>
</div>
<br />

:::warning Common Timing Issue on Outdated LiveSplit
<sub><sup>This issue has been resolved on the latest versions of LiveSplit.</sup></sub>

Sometimes, LiveSplit will revert the timing method to "Real Time" instead of "Game Time". If you're having timing issues
where timing continues through loads or other problems, make sure to right-click LiveSplit, go to "Compare Against", and
make sure "Game Time" is selected.

## Preset Splits File

If you don't want to manually add all the segments, you can download a preset [splits file here](/lss/portal-splits.lss)
to save yourself the trouble. Then, go into LiveSplit, right click, hover "Open Splits", and click "From File...". Then
select the file you downloaded.
