# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with speedrunning [Portal (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)).

![Portal](/img/portal-bg-720.jpg)

It will explain how to set up the game, the various versions of the game
that are commonly used in speedrunning, and various tools that are used to help speedrunners. It will also explain
the techniques used in Portal speedrunning, and how to perform them.

:::tip Play Portal casually first
Before you start, you should have a basic understanding of how to play Portal. If you have never played Portal before,
you should play through the game casually before attempting to speedrun it. This isn't strictly required, but it is highly
recommended.

# Getting the Game

First, you should be familiar with the various versions of Portal. Each version explained below has its own page with
more information, and its own reasons for being used. There are technically more versions of Portal, but these are the
most commonly used ones.

## Source Unpack <a href="https://wiki.sourceruns.org/wiki/Source_Unpack"><button className="button button--primary">Wiki</button></a> {#source-unpack}
:::tip Use Source Unpack
It comes preconfigured with useful tools, saves, and is the most commonly run version of the game.
:::

Source Unpack is an archive of the game's files at particular points
in time. It is used for speedrunning, because it allows you to use older versions of the game that have more glitches
and exploits. It also "unpacks" the games asset files for easy access, and includes a few other useful tools like
[SPT](https://github.com/YaLTeR/SourcePauseTool) and the [Speedrun Demo Record Plugin](https://github.com/RedHaze/speedrun-demo-record-unified).
Source Unpack is community driven, very reputable, and very safe. If you are concerned about it's safety, you can
technically use the Steam version of the game, but it is not recommended.

:::info Versions
<Tabs defaultValue="5135">
    <TabItem value="steampipe" label="Steampipe">
        This is the version of the game that comes with Steam. Typically, this version is not used for speedrunning. It
        is recommended that you use Source Unpack instead, because Steampipe patches out various glitches and exploits
        commonly used in speedruns.<br /><br />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="5135" label="5135">
        This is the most commonly used version of Source Unpack, which is based on the 5135 build of the game. It is
        recommended that you use this version for speedrunning, unless you are doing high level OOB or NoSLA runs. If you
        are just getting started, this is typically the way to go.<br /><br />

    <TabItem value="3420" label="3420">
        This is an older version of Source Unpack, which is based on the 3420 build of the game. It is recommended that
        you use this version for high level OOB and NoSLA runs. If you are just getting started, this is typically not
        necessary to use.<br /><br />

### Running Source Unpack
To run Source Unpack, just unzip the archive and run `Portal.bat`. This will require that you have Steam running, and own
Portal on Steam to work.


## Timing

Timing begins when the crosshair appears and ends when it disappears after GLaDOS dies. Timing is done using game time,
otherwise known as "engine ticks", while also including time spent paused. Loading screens are not timed.

You are allowed to skip the intro vault waiting sequence by using the [vault save](/resources/saves#vault_save).

Timing your runs can be done either through recording demos, or through recording a video with LiveSplit running.
It is highly recommended to use LiveSplit, it comes with auto splitting and a timer plugin that automatically times
everything exactly as it should be timed. You can find a guide on how to set up LiveSplit [here](/resources/livesplit).

## Enable the Console

We take advantage of the Source Engine console to run commands that help us speedrun. To enable the console, go to
`Options > Keyboard > Advanced...` and check the box that says `Enable developer console`. You can now open the
developer console by pressing the tilde key (`~`).

To learn more about the console and allowed commands, check out the [commands page](/commands-options-binds).
